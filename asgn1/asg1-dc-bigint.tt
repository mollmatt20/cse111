1.  Using C++11/14/17 (g++ -std=gnu++20)

All programming in this course will be done C++ style, not C style.

    +-----------------------------+------------------------------+
    |Do not use:                  | Instead, use:                |
    +-----------------------------+------------------------------+
    |char* strings                | <string>                     |
    |C arrays                     | <vector>                     |
    |<stdio.h>, <cstdio>          | <iostream>, <iomanip>        |
    |pointers                     | <shared_ptr> or <unique_ptr> |
    |union                        | inheritance or <variant>     |
    |<header.h>                   | <cheader>                    |
    +-----------------------------+------------------------------+

Include only C++ header files and use the declaration using namespace
std;  Include <cheader> files only when C++ header files do not
provide a necessary facility.  Include <header.h> files from C only
when an appropriate <cheader> file does not exist.  Use the script
cpplint.py.perl (a wrapper for cpplint.py) to check style.

The production system for all work is unix.ucsc.edu using g++.
Compile with
   g++ -std=gnu++20 -g -O0 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow -Wold-
style-cast
Following is a description of these options:
    -std=gnu++20 Gnu dialect of C++20.
    -g produces debugging information into object files and the
     binary executable.  This is necessary for gdb and valgrind to use
     symbolic names.
    -O0 reduces compilation time and makes debugging produce more
     expected results.  Optimization may rearrange bugs in code in
     unexpected ways.
    -Wall enables all the warnngs about questionable constructions.
    -Wextra enables extra warnings that are not enabled with -Wall.
    -Wpedantic issues all warnings required by strict ISO C++ and
     rejects all programs that do not conform to ISO C++.
    -Wshadow warns whenever a local variable or declaration shadows
     another variable, parameter, or class member.
    -Wold-style-cast warns about the use of any old-style (C-style)
     cast.  Instead, use one of:  static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_
     cast, reinterpret_cast.  Better yet, code in such a way as to not
     need casts.
    -fdiagnostics-color=never prevents the compiler from using those
     silly annoying colors in diagnostics.

The particular g++ compiler we will be using is
   -bash-1$ which g++
   /opt/rh/devtoolset-11/root/usr/bin/g++
   -bash-2$ g++ --version | grep -i g++
   g++ (GCC) 11.2.1 20210728 (Red Hat 11.2.1-1)
   -bash-3$ uname -npo
   unix1.lt.ucsc.edu x86_64 GNU/Linux

If you develop on your personal system, be sure to port and test your
code on the Linux timeshares.  If it compiles and runs on your system,
but not on the timeshares, then it does not work.

2.  Overview

This assignment will involve overloading basic integer operators to
perform arbitrary precision integer arithmetic in the style of dc(1).
Your class bigint will intermix arbitrarily with simple integer
arithmetic.

To begin read the man(1) page for the command dc(1):
   man -s 1 dc
A copy of that page is also in this directory.  Your program will use
the standard dc as a reference  implemention and must produce exactly
the same output for the commands you have to implement:
   +  -  *  /  %  ^  c  d  f  p  q

If you have any questions as to the exact format of your output, just
run dc(1) and make sure that, for the operators specified above, your
program produces exactly the same output.  A useful program to compare
output from your program with that of dc(1) is diff(1), which compares
the contents of two files and prints only the differences.  Also look
in the subdirectory misc/ for some examples.

3.  Implementation strategy

As before, you have been given starter code.

 (a) Makefile, debug, and util If you find you need a function which
     does not properly belong to a given module, you may add it to
     util.

 (b) The module scanner reads in tokens, namely a NUMBER, an OPERATOR,
     or SCANEOF.  Each token returns a token_t, which indicates what
     kind of token it is (the terminal_symbol symbol), and the string
     lexinfo associated with the token.  Only in the case of a number
     is there more than one character.  Note that on input, an
     underscore (_) indicates a negative number.  The minus sign (-)
     is reserved only as a binary operator.  The scanner also has
     defined a couple of operator<< for printing out scanner results
     in debug mode.  This is strictly for debugging.

 (c) The main program main.cpp, has been implemented for you.  For the
     six binary arithmetic functions, the right operand is popped from
     the stack, then the left operand, then the result is pushed onto
     the stack.

 (d) The module iterstack can not just be the STL stack, since we want
     to iterate from top to bottom, and the STL stack does not have an
     iterator.  A stack depends on the operations back(), push_back(),
     and pop_back() in the underlying container.  We could use a
     vector, a deque, or just a list, as long as the requisite
     operations are available.

4.  Class bigint

Then we come to the most complex part of the assignment, namely the
class bigint.  Operators in this class are heavily overloaded.

 (a) Most of the functions take a arguments of type const bigint&, i.
     e., a constant reference, for the sake of efficiency.  But they
     have to return the result by value.

 (b) The operator<< can't be a member since its left operand is an
     ostream, so we make it a friend, so that it can see the innards
     of a bigint.  Note now dc prints really big numbers.  operator<<
     is used by debugging functions.

 (c) The function print (suitably modified) is used for actual output.

 (d) The relational operators == and < are coded individually as
     member functions.  The others, !=, <=, >, and >= are defined in
     terms of the essential two.

 (e) All of the functions of bigint only work with the sign, using
     ubigint to do the actual computations.  So bigint::operator+ and
     bigint::operator- will check the signs of the two operands then
     call ubigint::operator+ or ubigint::operator-, as appropriate,
     depending on the relative signs and magnitudes.  The
     multiplication and division operators just call the corresponding
     ubigint operators, then adjust the resulting sign according to
     the rule of signs.

5.  Class ubigint

Class ubigint implements unsigned large integers and is where the
computational work takes place.  Class bigint takes care of the sign.
Now we turn to the representation of a ubigint, which will be
represented by vector of bytes.

 (a) Replace the declaration
        using ubigvalue_t = unsigned long;
     with
        using ubigvalue_t = vector<uint8_t>;
     in the header file <ubigint.h>.  The type uint8_t is an unsigned
     8-bit integer defined in <cstdint>.

 (b) In storing the big integer, each digit is kept as an integer in
     the range 0 to 9 in an element of the vector.  Since the
     arithmetic operators add and subtract work from least significant
     digit to most significant digit, store the elements of the vector
     in the same order.  That means, for example, that the number 4629
     would be stored in a vector v as:  v[3]==4, v[2]==6, v[1]==2,
     v[0]==9.  In other words, if v[k]==d, then the digit's place
     value is d*pow(10,k).  In mathematical notation, the value of a
     radix 10 (base 10) number #v# with #n# digits is:

           .EQ
           sum from { i = 0 } to { n - 1 } v sub i 10 sup i
           ~ ~ = ~ ~
           v sub { n - 1 } 10 sup { n - 1 }
           + v sub { n - 2 } 10 sup { n - 2 }
           + ~ ... ~
           + v sub 2 10 sup 2
           + v sub 1 10 sup 1
           + v sub 0 10 sup 0
           .EN

 (c) In order for the comparisons to work correctly, always store
     numbers in a canonical form:  After computing a value from any
     one of the six arithmetic operators, always trim the vector by
     removing all high-order zeros:
        while (size() > 0 and back() == 0) pop_back();

 (d) Canonical form.
      Zero is represented as a vector of size zero and a positive
       sign.
      High-order zeros are suppressed.
      All digits are stored as uint8_t values in the range 0...9, not
       as characters in the range '0'...'9'.
      To print a digit, cast it to an integer:  cout << static_
       cast<int> (digit).
      This can be done more easily by:  cout << int (digit), which
       looks like a ctor call.

 (e) The scanner will produce numbers as strings, so scan each string
     from the end of the string, using a const_reverse_iterator (or
     other means) from the end of the string (least significant digit)
     to the beginning of the string (most significant digit) using
     push_back to append them to the vector.

6.  Implementation of operators

 (a) For bigint::operator+, check the signs.

      (1) If the signs are the same:
           Call ubigint::operator+ with the unsigned numbers.
           The sign of the result is the sign of either number.

      (2) If the signs are different:
           Call ubigint::operator- with the larger number as its left
            number.
           The sign of the result is the sign of the larger number.

 (b) The operator bigint::operator-, check the signs.

      (1) If the signs are different:
           Call ubigint::operator+ with the unsigned numbers.
           The sign of the result is the sign of the left number.

      (2) If the signs are the same:
           Call ubigint::operator- with the larger number as its left
            number.
           If the left number is larger, the sign of the result is
            its sign.
           Else the the result has the opposite of the sign of the
            right number.

 (c) For the above bigint::operator+ and bigint::operator-, to find
     the ``larger'' number, make use of ubigint::operator<.  Since the
     numbers are kept in canonical form (see above), to compare them:

      (1) Check the size() of each vector.  If different, the larger
          number has the greater size.

      (2) If the sizes are the same, write a loop iterating from the
          highest-order digit toward the lowest-order digit, comparing
          digit by digit.
           As soon as a difference is found, return true or false, as
            appriate.
           If all digits are the same, then return false.

 (d) To implement ubigint::operator+, create a new ubigint and proceed
     from the low order end to the high order end, adding digits
     pairwise.  For any sum >= 10, take the remainder and add the
     carry to the next digit.  Use push_back to append the new digits
     to the ubigint.  When you run out of digits in the shorter
     number, continue, matching the longer vector with zeros, until it
     is done.  Make sure the sign of 0 is positive.

 (e) To implement ubigint::operator-, also create a new empty vector,
     starting from the low order end and continuing until the high
     end.  If the left digit is smaller than the right digit, the
     subtraction will be less than zero.  In that case, add 10 to the
     digit, and set the borrow to the next digit to -1.  After the
     algorithm is done, pop_back all high order zeros from the vector
     before returning it.  Make sure the sign of 0 is positive.

 (f) To implement bigint::operator==, check to see if the signs are
     the same and ubigint::operator== returns true.

 (g) To implement ubigint::operator==, just use the vector::operator==
     comparison function.

 (h) To implement bigint::operator<, remember that a negative number
     is less than a positive number.  If the signs are the same, use
     ubigint::operator< for a comparison.  For positive numbers, the
     smaller one is less.  and for negative nubmers, the larger one is
     less.

 (i) To implement ubigint::operator<, check the size() of each vector.
     The shorter one is less than the longer one.  If the size() are
     the same, scan the vectors in parallel from the most significant
     digit to the last significant digit until a difference is found.

 (j) Implement function bigint::operator*, which uses the rule of
     signs to determine the result.  The number crunching is delegated
     to ubigint::operator*, which produces the unsigned result.

 (k) Multiplication in ubigint::operator* proceeds by allocating a new
     vector whose size is equal to the sum of the sizes of the other
     two operands.  If u is a vector of size m and v is a vector of
     size n, then in O(mn) speed, perform an outer loop over one
     argument and an inner loop over the other argument, adding the
     new partial products to the product p as you would by hand.  The
     algorithm can be described as follows:

        p = all zeros
        for i in interval [0,m):
           carry = 0
           for j in interval [0,n):
              digit = p[i+j] + u[i] * v[j] + carry
              p[i+j] = digit % 10
              carry = digit / 10
           p[i+n] = carry

     Note that the interval [a,b) refers to the half-open interval
     including a but excluding b.  This is the set {x| a<=x && x<b}.
     In the same way, a pair of iterators in C++ is used to bound an
     interval (begin and end pair).

 (l) Long division is complicated if done correctly.  See a paper by
     P. Brinch Hansen, ``Multiple-length division revisited:  A tour
     of the minefield'', Software -- Practice and Experience 24, (June
     1994), 579-601.  Algorithms 1 to 12 are on pages 13-23, Note that
     in Pascal, array bounds are part of the type, which is not true
     for vectors in C++.
      multiple-length-division.pdf
      http://brinch-hansen.net/papers/1994b.pdf
      http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.14.5815

 (m) The function divide as implemented uses the ancient Egyptian
     division algorithm, which is slower than Hansen's Pascal program,
     but is easier to understand.  Replace the long values in it by
     vector<digit_t>.  The logic is shown also in misc/divisioncpp.
     cpp.  The algorithm is rather slow, but the big-O analysis is
     reasonable.

 (n) The unsigned division function that is provided depends on two
     private functions, multiply_by_2 and divide_by_2, which are in-
     lace non-constant functions.  They both perform without creating
     a new object.

      (1) To implement multiply_by_2, iterate from the low order
          digit, and double each digit (remainder 10), carrying to the
          next higher digit.  At the end, if the carry is 1, use push_
          back.

      (2) To implement divide_by_2, iterate from the low order digit,
          and divide each digit by 2.  Then, if the next higher digit
          is odd, add 5 to the current digit.  Be careful of the end,
          and pop_back any remaining high order zeros.

 (o) Modify operator<<, first just to print out the number all in one
     line.  You will need this to debug your program.

 (p) The function print will print numbers in the same way as dc(1)
     does.

 (q) The pow function uses other operations to raise a number to a
     power.  If the exponent does not fit into a single long print an
     error message, otherwise do the computation.  The power function
     is not a member of either bigint or ubigint, and is just
     considered a library function that is implemented using more
     primitive operations.

7.  Memory leak and other problems

Make sure that you test your program completely so that it does not
crash on a Segmentation Fault or any other unexpected error.  Since
you are not using pointers, and all values are inline, there should be
no memory leak.  Use valgrind(1) to check for and eliminate
uninitialized variables and memory leak.

If your program is producing strange output or segmentation faults,
use gdb(1) and the debug macros in the debug module of the code/
subdirectory.

8.  What to submit

Submit source files and only source files:  Makefile, README, and all
of the header and implementation files necessary to build the target
executable.  If gmake does not build ydc your program can not be
tested and you lose 1/2 of the points for the assignment.  Use
checksource on  your code to verify basic formatting.

Look in the grader's score subdirectory for instructions to graders.
Read Syllabus/pair-programming/ and also submit PARTNER if you are
doing pair programming.  Either way submit the README described
therein.

9.  Et cetera.

The accuracy of the Unix utility dc(1) can be checked by:
echo '82 43/25 43+65P80P82P73P76P32P70P79P79P76P10P' | dc
