1.  Introduction

This lab will not be graded and there is no credit for it.  However,
it is important you understand the Unix command line and submit
procedure before you actually use it in the first assignment.  Learn
how to submit files.  Submit these files to lab0.  Verify that the
submit actually worked by looking in the submit directory for your
username.  The find(1) command is very useful for things like this.

The submit command copies your files into a directory
   /afs/cats.ucsc.edu/class/cse111-wm.s22/lab0/$USER
and prefixes each file with a sequence number.  You can see the names
of the files, but not their contents.  The actual syntax of the submit
command is:
   submit cse111-wm.s22 lab0 files...

2.  Prior experience

Prior experience with Unix is assumed.  You should know the following:
    The C language, from a prerequisite course.
    General use of Linux commands, and specifically submit and
     checksource.
    Use of environment variables and setting the $PATH variable.
    Construction and use of Makefiles.
    A code archival system such as rcs, cvs, svn, git, etc.

Attend a lab section to ask questions if you don't understand how
submit and the Unix command line in general works.  The TA can explain
such things.  Also read the submit checklist:  Syllabus/submit-
checklist.

There are some scripts that are available, such as checksource,
cpplint.py, cpplint.py.perl, cid, and others.  These can be made
available by adding the following to your $PATH environment variable:
   /afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cse111-wm/bin
This can be done with the following line in your $HOME/.bash_profile:
   export PATH=$PATH:/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cse111-wm/bin

3.  Version of C++
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -bash-1$ which g++                                                  |

| -bash-2$ g++ --version | grep -i g++                                |
| g++ (GCC) 11.2.1 20210728 (Red Hat 11.2.1-1)                        |
| -bash-3$ uname -npo                                                 |
+-unix2.lt.ucsc.edu-x86_64-GNU/Linux----------------------------------+

Be sure that any textbook or other reference to C++ includes at least
C++11 on its cover documentation, and preferably C++14 or C++17.
Whenever you need to look up information about C++, or look at
http://www.cplusplus.com/.

Any code you develop must compile and run on unix.ucsc.edu.  That is
the only environment the graders will be using.  If you are developing
on your own system, verify that the compiler you are using is at least
C++14 compliant.  Frequently port your code to unix.ucsc.edu and
verify that it compiles and runs there.  If it does not work there,
then it does not work.

4.  Review of C and make

The prerequisite for this course is a knowledge of C, the use of the
make(1) utility, and the use of Unix in general.  As a review, write
the following program and submit to lab0.  There is no credit for this
lab and it will not be graded, but it is useful to verify that you
have the necessary knowledge of C.  Alternatively, write the following
program in C++.

5.  Program specification

Write a program countwords that will read in words from all files
specified on the command line, or from the standard input if no files
are specified on the command line.  After all of the files have been
read in, print each word followed by a count of the number of times it
occurred.  A word is any sequence of alphabetical (isalpha(3))
characters, and words are converted to lower case (tolower(3)).  The
following Perl program (countwords.perl) shows the required
functionality.  You do not need to know Perl in order to run the
program.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| #!/usr/bin/perl                                                     |
| # $Id: countwords.perl,v 1.1 2020-01-02 14:32:14-08 - - $           |
| map {++$words{lc $_}} m/([[:alpha:]]+)/g while <>;                  |
+-print-"$_-$words{$_}\n"-for-sort-keys-%words;-----------------------+

6.  Program implementation

Write a program in C consisting of three modules as shown here.  Also
construct a Makefile with the usual targets all, clean, and spotless,
and recipies to build the object files and binary from source files.
Do not assume anything about the maximum length of a word, the maximum
number of words in the file, the maximum number of files, or any other
maxima.  Suggested files:
 (a) vstring.h, vstring.c -- implements a variable string into which
     characters can be accumulated, using array doubling when the
     length of the string is exceeded.
 (b) wordlist.h, wordlist.c -- implements a list sorted
     lexicographically with each element of the list containing a word
     and a count.
 (c) main.c -- iterates over all of the files specified on the command
     line, or the standard input if none.  For each word found in each
     line, insert into the list, updating the count.  At end of file,
     print out all of the words in lexicographic order along with the
     count of the number of times each word appears.
 (d) Makefile targets:
      all :  builds the executable binary.
      ${EXECBIN} :  builds the executable from the object files.
      %.o :  builds object files from source files.
      clean :  removes the object files.
      spotless :  first does clean, then removes any files not part
       of the source.
      Makefile.deps :  builds the dependency file.

As mentioned, this program will not be graded, so coding it is
optional, but you should verify that you know enough C to do it.
Exact specification details depend on variations on implementation
preferences.

7.  Alternative versions

Use a binary search tree instead of a simple linear list.

Use a hash table to hold the information, then sort the table before
printing.

Code in C++, but do not use any of <map>, <regex>, <string>, <vector>.
Use only raw pointers, structs, malloc(3), and free(3) for the data
structures.

9.  Simple C++ programs

Some simple programs you might want to consider as practice for an
introduction to C++:

 (a) Write a program which reads words and at end of file, prints the
     number of words found in cin.  If string word is a variable, cin
     >> word will read in the next white-space delimited word.

 (b) Write a program which used cin >> to read numbers.  At end of
     file, print the average.

 (c) Any other simple program you have implemented in your first
     programming course, re-implement it in C++.

Submit these to lab 0.  Reminder:  lab 0 will not be graded -- it is
just a review of Unix and the submit command.
